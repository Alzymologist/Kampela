  The Temperature Driver measures the temperature using the EMU internal temperature
  sensor which is present on some EFR32 and EFM32 devices. Application specific callback
  functions can be registered and will be called on given temperature thresholds.
  The EMU internal temperature sensor is running in EM0-EM4H and is capable of waking
  up the core on temperature change. The EMU temperature sensor is running continuously
  and measurements are taken every 250 ms. For devices where errata EMU_E201 applies,
  the temperature driver implements a workaround where EMU settings are adjusted according
  to the measured temperature. More information on this errata workaround can be found in
  application note AN1027.
