description: >
  The UART USART driver supports the UART capabilities of the USART
  peripheral. The driver is fully reentrant and supports multiple driver 
  instances. Both blocking and non-blocking transfer functions are available. 
  The non-blocking transfer functions use DMA to transfer data and report 
  transfer completion with callback functions. Note that the blocking functions 
  are not suitable for low energy applications because they use CPU polling.


  If the Services->Runtime->System Setup->System Init component is included in
  a project, the driver instances will be initialized automatically, using the
  instance configurations, during the sl_system_init() call in main.c.


  Selecting this component will also include the UARTDRV Core component, which is 
  the implementation of the UARTDRV driver itself.
