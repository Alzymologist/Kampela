description: >
  Co-Processor Communication (CPC) allows for communication between a Primary 
  and a secondary device using a single physical link. Both devices can have
  multiple endpoints that both produce and consume data and CPC will handle
  the multiplexing/demultiplexing of the data to the target. CPC also allows 
  for data encryption, mitigating the risks of transmitting data on an 
  unsecured physical data link.

  This component implements the CPC Secondary device, allowing it to communicate 
  to a Primary device.
