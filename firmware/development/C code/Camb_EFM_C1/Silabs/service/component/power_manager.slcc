description: >
  Instantiate the Power Manager (PM) component for managing the power
  consumption of the MCU. The PM will shut down the high-frequency clock and put
  the system in lower Energy Modes (EM) when possible. The PM also allows the
  user to register certain callback that will be executed when going into/out of
  certain EM. This allows the user to carry out any bookkeeping following EM
  transition events.
