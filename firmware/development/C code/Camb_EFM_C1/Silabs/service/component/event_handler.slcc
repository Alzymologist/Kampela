description: |
  Provides a way for components to register event handlers with events.
  Events are expected to be registered by the component providing the event
  using the `event` template contribution key. Event handlers are registered
  with an event using the `event_handler` template contribution key.
  A template provided by this component generates the event handler function
  for each event, which calls out to all registered event handlers.

  Example:

  ```yaml
  template_contribution:
    - name: event
      value:
        id: my_event
        function:
          name: my_event_handler
          return: void
    - name: event_handler
      value:
        event: my_event
        include: foo.h
        handler: sl_foo
    - name: event_handler
      value:
        event: my_event
        include: bar.h
        handler: sl_bar
  ```

  generates

  ```c
  #include foo.h
  #include bar.h

  void my_event_handler(void)
  {
    sl_foo();
    sl_bar();
  }
  ```
