description: >
  The IO Stream component allows to read/write data using a variety of physical
  communication interfaces, or Streams. This allows for standardized data 
  transfer operations while abstracting the underlying interface. IO Stream
  also enables the implementation of the printf standard C function, using the
  configured Stream, making it easier to send formatted data over a physical link.
  For IO Stream to be able to use a physical link, the corresponding IO Stream driver
  component must be added to your project. Note that a project may have multiple instances
  of IO Stream, allowing for communication over multiple physical links at the same
  time.
