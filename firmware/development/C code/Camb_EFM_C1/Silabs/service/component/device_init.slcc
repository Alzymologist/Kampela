label: "Automatic Device Initialization"
package: platform
description: >
  This component automatically handles the installation of all required device 
  components for proper MCU operation. The hardware peripherals that will
  be initialized will depend on the specific device's capabilities. Individual
  component configuration can be edited by selecting from the "Peripherals" 
  sub-menu. 

  In the event that the user wants to implement its own initialization routine
  for any of the peripherals under the "Peripherals" sub-menu, it is recommended 
  to uninstall this component, as well as the corresponding peripheral's 
  initialization component.
