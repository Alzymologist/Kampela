 * output bytes before it's ready for the next byte.
 *
 * @param len     new frame flag / length of the frame to be encoded.
 * A non-zero value begins a new frame, so all subsequent calls must use zero.
 * The length includes control byte and data field, but not the flag or crc.
 * This function does not validate the length.
 *
 * @param byte    the next byte of data to add to the frame.
 * Note that in general the same byte of data may have to be passed more than
 * once as escape bytes, the CRC and the end flag byte are output.
 *
 * @param offset  pointer to the offset of the next input byte.
 * (If the frame data is the array data[], the next byte would be data[offset].)
 * Is set to 0 when starting a new frame (ie, len is non-zero).
 * Is set to 0xFF when the last byte of the frame is returned.
