 * @brief IO Stream VUART
 * @details
 * ## Overview
 *
 *   Virtual UART (VUART) is a special interface where RTT is used as input channel
 *   and the Serial Wire Output(SWO) is used as output channel.
 *
 *   On the receive side, a RTT buffer with a dedicated name is allocated for
 *   the reception.
 *
 *   IOStream-VUART uses SWO-stimulus 8 as output channel. Note that the transmit
 *   channel also implements a small protocol, so the data is encapsulated in a
 *   frame which must be decoded on the host side.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 *
 *   The stream sets itself as the default stream at the end of the initialization
 *   function.You must reconfigure the default interface if you have multiple streams
 *   in your project else the last stream initialized will be set as the system default
 *   stream.
 *
 * ## Power manager integration
 *
 *   Because RTT communication uses the J-link debug interface, when going into EM2
 *   or EM3, the system will actually go into a special EM2 where the high-Frequency
 *   clocks are still running and some CPU core functionalities are still powered to
 *   maintain the debug features.Therefore it is unwise to keep a debug interface with
 *   RTT channel open if you want to test your power consumption.
 *
 * ## Communication channel connection
 *
 *   For connecting to the vuart console you need to use the WSTK and you must be
 *   connected using the ethernet link. Then you can open a telnet session on port
 *   4900 using the WSTK IP address. Note that the WSTK firmware decodes the
 *   received frame and it outputs only the payload into vuart console.
