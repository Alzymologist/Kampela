 * @brief I/O Stream RTT
 * @details
 * ## Overview
 *
 *   Real Time Transfer (RTT) is a bi-directional communication interface developed
 *   by Segger and used with J-Link module. You need to have the Segger RTT library
 *   in your project to use this stream. It is offered as a third-party module in
 *   the Silicon Labs SDK.
 *
 *   RTT module uses a control block structure located in RAM memory with a specific
 *   ID so that it can be discovered when a connection is established via J-Link.
 *   The control block references a ring buffer for each configured channel. You can
 *   configure the number and size of the ring buffers at compile-time in
 *   SEGGER_RTT_Conf.h configuration file. Please refer to Segger's documentation
 *   for further information on RTT.
 *
 *   Note that you should only use this stream in a development environment. You
 *   should avoid using it in production.
 *
 * ## Initialization
 *
 *   The stream sets itself as the default stream at the end of the initialization
 *   function.You must reconfigure the default interface if you have multiple streams
 *   in your project else the last stream initialized will be set as the system default
 *   stream.
 *
 * ## Power manager integration
 *
 *   Because RTT communication uses the J-link debug interface when going into EM2 or EM3,
 *   the system will actually go into a special Energy Mode to maintain the debug
 *   capabilities and the power consumption will still remain high. Therefore it is unwise
 *   to keep a debug interface with RTT channel open if you want to test your power
 *   consumption.
 *
 * ## Communication channel connection
 *
 *   For connecting to the RTT channel you can use the tools provided by Segger or you
 *   can open a telnet session and connect to the port 19021 using your host IP
 *   address when the debugger is connected using USB and using J-Link debugger IP address
 *   when your debugger is connected over ethernet.
