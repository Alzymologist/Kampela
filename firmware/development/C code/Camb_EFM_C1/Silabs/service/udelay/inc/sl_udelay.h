/**
 * @brief
 *   Delay a number of microseconds
 *
 * @details
 *   This function will use a busy loop to delay code execution by a certain
 *   number of microseconds before returning to the caller. This function will
 *   not return to the caller earlier than the time given as the input parameter.
 *   This function will not use any hardware timing peripherals, it is using
 *   the core clock frequency to calculate the delay.
 *
 *   Note that there will always be some overhead associated with calling this
 *   function in addition to the internal delay loop. This overhead is relatively
 *   small when the delay is large (>= 100us).
 *
 *   The accuracy of this delay loop will be affected by interrupts and context
 *   switching. If accuracy is needed, a hardware timer should be used
 *   to handle delays.
 *
 * @param[in] us
 *   This is the number of microseconds to delay execution. This function will
 *   return after this amount of time has elapsed. Minimum value is 0 us and
 *   maximum value is 100 000 us (100 ms). It is however recommended to use
 *   the sleeptimer api for delays of more than 1 ms as it is using a hardware
 *   counter and will result in better accuracy.
