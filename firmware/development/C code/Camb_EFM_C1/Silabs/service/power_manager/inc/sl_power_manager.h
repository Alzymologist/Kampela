 * @addtogroup power_manager Power Manager
 *
 * @details Power manager is a platform level software module that manages
 * the system's energy modes. Its main purpose is to transition the system to a
 * low energy mode when the processor has nothing to execute. The energy mode the
 * system will transition to is determined each time the system goes to sleep
 * using requirements. These requirements are set by the different software modules
 * (drivers, stacks, application code, etc...). Power manager also ensures a
 * strict control of some power hungry resources such as the high frequency
 * external oscillator (normally called HFXO). Power manager also
 * offers a notification mechanism through which any piece of software module can be
 * notified of energy mode transitions through callbacks.
 *
 * @note Sleep Driver is deprecated. Use Power Manager for all sleep-related
 *       operations. See <a href="https://www.silabs.com/documents/
 *       public/application-notes/
 *       an1358-migrating-from-sleep-driver-to-power-manager.pdf">AN1358:
 *       Migrating from Sleep Driver to Power Manager</a> for information on how
 *       to migrate from Sleep Driver to Power Manager.
 *
 * @details
 * ## Initialization
 *
 *   Power manager must be initialized prior to any call to power manager API.
 *   If sl_system is used, only sl_system_init() must be called, otherwise
 *   sl_power_manager_init() must be called manually. Note that power manager
 *   must be initialized after the clock(s), when initialized manually, as the
 *   power manager check which oscillators are used during the initialization phase.
 *
 * ## Add and remove requirements
 *
 *   The drivers should add and remove energy mode requirements, at runtime, on the
 *   lowest energy mode for them depending on their state. When calling
 *   sl_power_manager_sleep(), the lowest possible Energy mode will be automatically
 *   selected.
 *
 *   It is possible to add and remove requirements from ISR. If a specific energy mode
 *   is required in the ISR, but not required to generate the interrupt, a requirement
 *   on the energy mode can be added from the ISR. It is guaranteed that the associated
 *   clock will be active once sl_power_manager_add_requirement() returns. The EM
 *   requirement can be also be removed from an ISR.
 *
 * ## Subscribe to events
 *
 *   It possible to get notified when the system transition from a power level to
 *   another power level. This can allow to do some operations depending on which level
 *   the system goes, such as saving/restoring context.
 *
 * ## Sleep
 *
 *   When the software has no more operation and only need to wait for an event, the
 *   software must call sl_power_manager_sleep(). This is automatically done when the
 *   kernel is present, but it needs to be called from the super loop in a baremetal
 *   project.
 *
 * ## Query callback functions
 *
 * ### Is OK to sleep
 *
 *   Between the time `sl_power_manager_sleep` is called and the MCU is really put
 *   in a lower Energy mode, it is possible that an ISR occur and require the system
 *   to resume at that time instead of sleeping. So a callback is called in a critical
 *   section to validate that the MCU can go to sleep.
 *
 *   In case of an application that runs on an RTOS, the RTOS will take care of determining
 *   if it is ok to sleep. In case of a baremetal application, the function `sl_power_manager_is_ok_to_sleep()`
 *   will be generated automatically by Simplicity Studio's wizard.
 *   The function will look at multiple software modules from the SDK to take a decision.
 *   The application can contribute to the decision by defining the function `app_is_ok_to_sleep()`.
 *   If any of the software modules (including the application via `app_is_ok_to_sleep()`) return false,
 *   the process of entering in sleep will be aborted.
 *
 * ### Sleep on ISR exit
 *
 *   When the system enters sleep, the only way to wake it up is via an interrupt or
 *   exception. By default, power manager will assume that when an interrupt
 *   occurs and the corresponding ISR has been executed, the system must not go back
 *   to sleep. However, in the case where all the processing related to this interrupt
 *   is performed in the ISR, it is possible to go back to sleep by using this hook.
 *
 *   In case of an application that runs on an RTOS, the RTOS will take care of determining
 *   if the system can go back to sleep on ISR exit. Power manager will ensure the system resumes
 *   its operations as soon as a task is resumed, posted or that its delay expires.
 *   In case of a baremetal application, the function `sl_power_manager_sleep_on_isr_exit()` will be generated
 *   automatically by Simplicity Studio's wizard. The function will look at multiple software modules from the SDK
 *   to take a decision. The application can contribute to the decision by defining the
 *   function `app_sleep_on_isr_exit()`.
 *   The generated function will take a decision based on the value returned by the different software modules
 *   (including the application via `app_sleep_on_isr_exit()`):
 *
 *   `SL_POWER_MANAGER_IGNORE`: if the software module did not cause the system wakeup and/or doesn't want to contribute to the decision.
 *   `SL_POWER_MANAGER_SLEEP`: if the software module did cause the system wakeup, but the system should go back to sleep.
 *   `SL_POWER_MANAGER_WAKEUP`: if the software module did cause the system wakeup, and the system should not go back to sleep.
 *
 *   If any software module returned `SL_POWER_MANAGER_SLEEP` and none returned `SL_POWER_MANAGER_WAKEUP`,
 *   the system will go back to sleep. Any other combination will cause the system not to go back to sleep.
 *
 * ### Debugging feature
 *
 *   By setting the configuration define SL_POWER_MANAGER_DEBUG to 1, it is possible
 *   to record the requirements currently set and their owner. It is possible to print
 *   at any time a table that lists all the added requirements and their owner. This
 *   table can be printed by caling the function
 *   sl_power_manager_debug_print_em_requirements().
 *   Make sure to add the following define
 *   ```
 *   #define CURRENT_MODULE_NAME "<Module printable name here>"
 *   ```
 *   to any application code source file that adds and removes requirements.
 *
 * ## Usage Example
