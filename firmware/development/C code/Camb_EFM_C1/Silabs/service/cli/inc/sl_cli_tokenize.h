 * @brief
 *   Split a C-string on space, ignoring sections in {} or "".
 *
 * @note
 *   This function modifies the content of the input string,
 *   and points the pointers in tokens to addresses in the input string.
 *   In quote strings ("") or curly braces ({}), the string will not be split,
 *   The quotes will be removed, but curly braces are kept for validation.
 *   To avoid '"' being interpreted as start/end of quote string, it may be
 *   escaped using '\\"', both within and outside of "...". '{' may be escaped
 *   using *   '\\{'. There is no need for escaping '}', since only hex digits
 *   are allowed within {...}. Backslash also needs be be escaped, as '\\'.
 *
 * @param[in,out] input
 *   The C-string to be split. Must be '\0'-terminated. Will be modified,
 *   even if an error occurs.
 *
 * @param[out] token_c
 *   The number of tokens put in the token_v array.
 *
 * @param[out] token_v
 *   An array containing the tokens obtained from splitting.
 *
 * @return
 *   Status of the operation.
