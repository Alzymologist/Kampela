/***************************************************************************//**
 * @brief
 *  Delay the specified number of milliseconds.
 *  The function will block the CLI instance from executing any more commands
 *  until the specified time has elapsed. Other components will not be affected
 *  or blocked and will execute as expected during the delay.
 *
 * @note
 *  The function has a different implementation in a bare metal vs. kernel
 *  configurations.
 *  In a bare metal configuration, the components that require execution have a
 *  tick function that must be called regularly by the application. This is
 *  typically done in a loop in the main function. To prevent the loop in main
 *  from stalling, this delay function will return before the delay has completed.
 *  Subsequent calls to the CLI-tick function will not do any further CLI
 *  processing and will return until the delay has expired.
 *  In a kernel configuration, the delay function will block until the delay has
 *  expired. Other components running in separate tasks will execute as expected.
 *  Kernel configuration has no explicit tick functions or a main loop that has to
 *  be kept alive.
 *
 * @param[in] arguments
 *   A pointer to the command arguments.
