 * @brief RAM execution disable utilities can be used to disable execution from
 *        RAM and other selected memory regions.
 * @details
 *   RAM execution disable utilities are useful to protect against code injection attacks.
 *   These utilities make use of MPU to disable execution from RAM and other selected
 *   memory regions.
