 * Many Ember Connect API functions return an ::EmberStatus value to indicate
 * the success or failure of the call.
 * Return codes are one byte long.
 * This page documents the possible status codes and their meanings.
 *
 * See error-def.h for source code.
 *
 * See also error.h for information on how the values for the return codes are
 * built up from these definitions.
 * The file error-def.h is separated from error.h because utilities will use
 * this file to parse the return codes.
 *
 * @note Do not include error-def.h directly. It is included by
 * error.h inside an enum typedef, which is in turn included by ember.h.
