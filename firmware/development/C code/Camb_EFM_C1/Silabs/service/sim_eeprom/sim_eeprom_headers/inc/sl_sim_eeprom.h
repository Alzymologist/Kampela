/** @addtogroup simeepromcom Simulated EEPROM 1 and 2
 * @brief Simulated EEPROM 1 and 2 legacy storage.
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM 1 and 2 system (typically referred to as SimEE) is designed to
 * operate under the @ref token_manager
 * API and provide a non-volatile storage system.  For this reason, the SimEE1
 * and SimEE2 components do not have any public functions to call.
 *
 * @note SimEE is a legacy storage
 * system so this component exists to enable the modern @ref token_manager to
 * access existing devices that already have data stored in SimEE.
 * Since the flash write cycles
 * are finite, the Simulated EEPROM's primary purpose is to perform wear
 * leveling across several hardware flash pages, ultimately increasing the
 * number of times tokens may be written before a hardware failure.
 *
 * SimEE1 is designed to consume 8kB of
 * upper flash within which it will perform wear leveling.
 * SimEE2 is designed to consume 36kB of
 * upper flash within which it will perform wear leveling.
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM needs to periodically perform a page erase
 * operation to recover storage area for future token writes.  The page
 * erase operation requires an ATOMIC block of typically 21ms.  Since this is such a long
 * time to not be able to service any interrupts, the page erase operation is
 * under application control providing the application the opportunity to
 * decide when to perform the operation and complete any special handling
 * needed that might be needed.
 *
 * @note The best, safest, and recommended practice is for the application
 * to regularly and always perfom a page erase when the
 * application can expect and deal with the page erase delay.
 * Page erase will immediately return if there is nothing to
 * erase.  If there is something that needs to be erased, doing so
 * as regularly and as soon as possible will keep the SimEE in the
 * healthiest state possible.

 *
 * @param status  An ::EmberStatus error code indicating one of the conditions

 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN whenever a token is set and a page needs
 * to be erased.  If the main application loop does not periodically
 * call halSimEepromErasePage(), it is best to then erase a page in
 * response to ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED
 * when the pages <i>must</i> be erased to prevent data loss.
 * halSimEepromErasePage() needs to be called until it returns 0 to indicate
 * there are no more pages that need to be erased.  Ignoring
 * this indication and not erasing the pages will cause dropping the new data
 * trying to be written.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL when
 * the new data cannot be written due to unerased pages.  <b>Not erasing
 * pages regularly, not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_GREEN, or not erasing in response to
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_ERASE_PAGE_RED will cause
 * ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_FULL and the new data will be lost!.</b>  Any future
 * write attempts will be lost as well.
 *
 * This callback will report an EmberStatus of ::EMBER_SIM_EEPROM_REPAIRING
 * when the Simulated EEPROM needs to repair itself.  While there's nothing
 * for an app to do when the SimEE is going to repair itself (SimEE has to
 * be fully functional for the rest of the system to work), alert the
 * application to the fact that repairing is occuring.  There are debugging
 * scenarios where an app might want to know that repairing is happening;
 * such as monitoring frequency.
 * @note  Common situations will trigger an expected repair, such as using
 *        a new chip or changing token definitions.
 *
 * If the callback ever reports the status ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED or
 * ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED, this indicates a catastrophic failure in
 * flash writing, meaning either the address being written is not empty or the
 * write itself has failed.  If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_WRITE_INHIBITED is
 * encountered, the function ::halInternalSimEeRepair(false) should be called
 * and the chip should then be reset to allow proper initialization to recover.
 * If ::EMBER_ERR_FLASH_VERIFY_FAILED is encountered the Simulated EEPROM (and
 * tokens) on the specific chip with this error should not be trusted anymore.

/** @brief Erases a hardware flash page, if needed.
 *
 * This function can be
 * called at anytime from anywhere in the application (except ISRs) and will
 * only take effect
 * if needed (otherwise it will return immediately).  Since this function takes
 * 21ms to erase a hardware page during which interrupts cannot be serviced,
 * it is preferable to call this function while in a state that can withstand
 * being unresponsive for so long.  The Simulated EEPROM will periodically
 * request through the ::halSimEepromCallback() that a page be erased.  The
 * Simulated EEPROM will never erase a page (which could result in data loss)
 * and relies entirely on the application to call this function to approve
 * a page erase (only one erase per call to this function).
 *
 * The Simulated EEPROM depends on the ability to move between two Virtual
 * Pages, which are comprised of multiple hardware pages.  Before moving to the
 * unused Virtual Page, all hardware pages comprising the unused Virtual Page
 * must be erased first.  The erase time of a hardware flash page is 21ms.
 * During this time the chip will be unresponsive and unable to service an
 * interrupt or execute any code (due to the flash being unavailable during
 * the erase procedure).  This function is used to trigger a page erase.
 *
 * @return  A count of how many hardware pages are left to be erased.  This
 * return value allows for calling code to easily loop over this function
 * until the function returns 0.
