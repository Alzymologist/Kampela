# Kampela conveptual testing module

This PCB tests several important concepts that would be used in actual Kampela device.

## Signal forming circuit

Filter stage is added on data input channel to intercept smartphone data and active NFC tag responses.

## Touchpad

Connector for touchpad is added to this board.

## Overdrive indicator

Excess power is dissipated through a clamp with LED. Brightly shining this LED effectively indicates that signal power is more than enough and could be used for Kampela alignment.

## RAM

RAM chip is added to the board to check its performance with our power system.
