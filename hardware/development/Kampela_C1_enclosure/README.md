## Mechanical design

The Kampela enclosure must meet many requirements:
1. Transparent design - the user must, among other things, visually understand that his Kampela has an original open-source design, manufactured at an authorized factory without any visible modifications.
2. Resistance to physical hacking and modification - access to the modification of electronics and flashing not factory firmware should be as difficult as possible.
3. Resistance to accidental breakage, abrasion, and display breaking - the basic requirements for carrying a device in your backpack
4. Fixation on the phone during use - the possibility of convenient simultaneous work of the user with a smartphone and with the Kampela touch screen both on hands and in a fixed position on the table.
5. Consisting of 2 parts - Kampela itself and an additional NFC key in the form of a keychain inserted into the middle part of the Kampela antenna.
6. Large touchscreen display to allow simultaneous viewing of keys and entry of verification codes on a randomized touch keyboard.

Based on the requirements and research results, we decided to manufacture the Kampela enclosure in the form of casting the board and display using Low-Pressure Molding technology into transparent amber polyimide.
This technology offers good opportunities for Kampela:
- Low-Pressure Molding, unlike two-component molding and injection molding, allows electronics to be technologically molded without damage from pressure or temperature.
- Polyimide is transparent, you can make sure that the copy of Kampela has the original design and corresponds to the open-source documentation.
- With the correct technology, polyimide is almost impossible to separate from the board without visible traces, thus hidden modification of electronics is excluded.
- The material, after curing, has a hardness of 80 Shore A. In combination with the semi-gloss surface texture, Kampela will adhere well to a smartphone. This will make it easy to work with Kampela when using both on the go and the table.
- Low-Pressure Molding allows you to make the device completely sealed and shock-absorbing when dropped, making Kampela resistant to accidental breakage.

## How to make your prototype Amber Kampela

For the Kampela prototype, we prepared 3D models so that any enthusiast can repeat Kampela and test usability.
Low-Pressure Molding equipment is not available to everyone, but the technology of two-component molding of polyurethane into silicone molds allows you to repeat the concept of Kampela molding in almost any workshop.
The algorithm for pouring two-component polyurethane is as follows:
0. You should have a Kampela board assembled, sewn, and fully tested, a set of transparent molded silicone with a silicone mold hardener, a kit of molded two-component polyurethane for molding (amber, 80 Shore A), corrugated cardboard for mold walls, hot glue gun for sealing joints when pouring silicone, release wax spray, sharp scalpel for parting a mold, SLA 3D printer for printing a master model for pouring, dirty room or polyethylene-covered floor and workplace (be careful! Two-component casting components are very difficult to remove from furniture, floors, and clothes, so itâ€™s better to immediately tighten everything with disposable plastic wrap)
1. Print the master model on the SLA 3D printer using the STL file from the GitHub repository
2. Make a silicone mold box out of cardboard by adding a minimum of 3cm on each side of the master model. Be sure to seal the joint between the bottom and the walls of the box with a heat gun for pouring, otherwise, the silicone will leak into the joint, as it is very fluid.
3. Glue the master model to the bottom of the box with the Kampela screen facing up using thin double-sided tape so that it does not float when poured.
4. Spray the wax release agent onto the master model from above.
5. Mix and pour the casting silicone according to the instructions on it up to half the box, but so that the master model is completely covered with silicone. Wait for the silicone to cure
6. After curing, remove the pot from the box, turn it over and insert it into the box with the visible master pattern facing up. Do not remove the master model. Glue 2 wooden sticks or tubes from soda with a diameter of 4-6 mm to the master model on both sides of the mold to then pour polyurethane through them - one for pouring, the second for the air outlet. Spray the wax separator over the top. Fill the second half of the mold with silicone. Wait for confirmation.
7. After the mold has cured, you can split the mold, remove the master model, clean the mold with a brush or compressor from dirt and start casting polyurethane.
8. To fill the mold with polyurethane, assemble the injection mold: place the assembled Kampela board with the display, and position it on the buttons and silicone ledges in the master model. Close the mold and fasten sheets of hard cardboard at the top and bottom and fasten the mold with rubber bands so that it is tightly assembled, but the sprues are accessible for pouring with a syringe.
9. Mix polyurethane according to the instructions for it, and degas according to the instructions. Then, with a large disposable syringe of suitable capacity, without a needle, suck the polyurethane from the mixing container and pump it into the silicone mold until enough polyurethane comes out of the air hole. Make sure that the form lies on a plane horizontally so that the polyurethane does not flow out and there is no possibility of the formation of bubbles in the voids of the form that will be above the air outlet channel.
10. Once the polyurethane has cured, you can use your sealed and shockproof Kampela.
