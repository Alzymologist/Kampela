This is a summary of the Kampela survey results. 28 users participated in the survey. We divided users into three groups depending on their technical level:  

***Cryptocurrency users and enthusiasts***. This group consists of 13 users who use cryptocurrencies or consider themself blockchain enthusiasts, but do not work in blockchain-related business. This group is less technical but contains some active substrate users.  Here 9/13 of users have not used substrate coins and 4/13 use them often or occasionally. Among this group, 9/13 of users do not use or do not know what account derivation is, while only 4/13 use multiple derivations or won't tell. Interestingly, the usage of derivations does not correlate significantly with the usage of hardware wallets here. Among 5 users of hardware wallets 1 user does not use derivations, 1 does not know about them, and 1 won't tell.  

***Employees in blockchain-related business***.  This group consists of 8 users who are in the blockchain-related business, but are not blockchain developers.This group is very diverse.  Here 4/8 people have not used substrate coins, 3/8 participants used them several times and 1 participant uses substrate coins often or occasionally. Results on account derivation and hardware wallets contain all kinds of answers and show no discernable pattern.  

***Blockchain developers***. This group consists of 6 blockchain developers. Technically skilled and highly uniform group. Here 5/6 participants have used substrate coins, 5/6 use multiple account derivation, and 5/6 participants use hardware wallets.  

## Main results  

Three distinguished groups of participants may be discerned:  
* (1) Crypto users and enthusiasts â€“ less technical, but  some are active substrate users;  
* (2) Very diverse group of employees in blockchain-related businesses;  
* (3) Technically minded and surprisingly uniform group of blockchain developers.  

Participants use a plethora of hardware wallets:
* Ledger (5 mentions);  
* Parity Signer (4 mentions);  
* Ledger nano (3 mentions);  
* Trezor (3 mentions);  
* Safepal (1 mention).  

Users either use multiple derivations or do not know/do not use/won't tell about derivations at all. No user communicated about using only one derivation!  

Users are indeed very secretive: only 5/28 people decided to leave their names, and only 6/28 people left their e-mails.
