This is a summary of the Kampela survey results. 31 users participated in the survey. We divided users into three groups depending on their technical level:  

***Cryptocurrency users and enthusiasts***. This group consists of 14 users who use cryptocurrencies or consider themself blockchain enthusiasts, but do not work in blockchain-related business. This group is less technical but contains some active substrate users. Here 10/14 of users have not used substrate coins and 4/14 use them often or occasionally. Among this group, 10/14 of users do not use or do not know what account derivation is, while only 4/14 use multiple derivations or won't tell. 5/14 participants use hardware wallets. Wallets metioned: ledger * 3, ledger nano, trezor, safepal. Interestingly, the usage of derivations does not seem to correlate with the usage of hardware wallets here: among these users 1 participant does not use derivations, 1 does not know about them, and 1 won't tell, only 2 participants use multiple derivations.

***Employees in blockchain-related business***. This group consists of 10 users who are in the blockchain-related business, but are not blockchain developers. This group is very diverse. Here 6/10 participants have not used substrate coins, 3/10 participants used them several times and 1/10 participant uses substrate coins often or occasionally. Results on account derivation and hardware wallets contain all kinds of answers and show no discernable pattern.  

***Blockchain developers***. This group consists of 6 blockchain developers. Technically skilled and highly uniform group. Here 5/6 participants have used substrate coins, 5/6 use multiple account derivation, and 5/6 participants use hardware wallets.  

## Main results  
Three distinguished groups of participants may be discerned:  
* (1) Crypto users and enthusiasts â€“ less technical, but  some are active substrate users;  
* (2) Very diverse group of employees in blockchain-related businesses;  
* (3) Technically minded and surprisingly uniform group of blockchain developers.  

Participants use a plethora of hardware wallets:
* Ledger        (6 mentions);  
* Parity signer (4 mentions);  
* Trezor        (3 mentions);  
* Ledger nano   (2 mentions);  
* Ledger nano S (1 mention);  
* Safepal       (1 mention).  
 
Users either use multiple derivations or do not know/do not use/won't tell about derivations at all. Only single user communicated about using one derivation.  

The overwhelmingly common user problem with current hardware wallets is the ease and accesibility, 8/31 participants did mention it, they are comming from all meantioned groups. Exact responses are:
* "design and accesibility (User Friendliness)", response by employee in blockchain business;
* "Not easy to use", response by cryptocurrency user;
* "I would like to see more user friendly hardware wallets that are easier to understand and navigate", response by employee in blockchain business;
* "better and simple interface for dummies", response by cryptocurrency user;
* "slow interface (buttons)", response by cryptocurrency user;
* "I'm lazy for buying and using it", response by cryptocurrency user;
* "Ease of getting to approval", response by blockchain developer;
* "ugly ux", response by blockchain developer.

Closed source hardware and software is only reported as an issue by 3/31 participants.  

Users are indeed secretive: only 5/31 people decided to leave their names, and only 8/31 people left their e-mails.
